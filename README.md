# ConcatVideo

ConcatVideo is a utility designed to merge multiple video files by concatenating their frames into one continuous video stream. The program treats the first video in the sequence as the primary source, setting the benchmark for the duration, frame rate, and resolution of the final output. It supports various methods for combining the video data, including basic addition, bitwise operations (OR, AND, XOR, NOT), and blending techniques (alpha blending and XOR alpha blending). This ensures that the resultant video seamlessly integrates data from each selected file on a frame-by-frame basis.

* 1.0 - You can add videos and concatenate the frames together.
